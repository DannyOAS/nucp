                    <p class="leading-relaxed">We at Norhi understand the importance of keeping your personal information confidential. We do not sell or rent your personal information. We only disclose your information in the following circumstances, and always in accordance with PIPEDA and other applicable laws:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share personal information with third-party service providers or partners who perform services on our behalf. For example, this can include cloud hosting providers, data analytics services, email delivery services, customer support tools, or other IT service providers. These third parties are given only the information necessary to perform their functions, and they are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it solely for the purposes of providing their services to us.</li>
                        <li><strong>Healthcare Partners:</strong> If you are using Norhi's platform as part of a healthcare organization or clinic, information (including patient information) you input may be shared with or accessible to authorized individuals within that organization in accordance with that organization's policies and agreements. Norhi acts as a service provider (or "agent") to those healthcare providers in handling patient data, and we do so consistent with applicable privacy laws (such as PIPEDA and PHIPA).</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Compliance and Protection:</strong> We may disclose personal information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. We may also disclose information to enforce our agreements or policies, to detect, investigate and help prevent security, fraud or technical issues, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Norhi, our users, patients, or the public. If we receive an access request or inquiry from law enforcement or regulators, we will only disclose personal information provided we are legally required or permitted to do so.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Transactions:</strong> If Norhi is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your personal information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate of Norhi as part of that transaction. In such cases, we will ensure that appropriate privacy protections are in place and that the recipient of the information continues to honour the commitments of this Privacy Policy (unless you consent otherwise).</li>
                        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your personal information with other third parties in situations where you have given us your explicit consent to do so. For instance, if you request that we share data with a third-party application or partner, we will do so only with your authorization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">In all cases, we share the minimum information necessary and evaluate requests for information carefully. If personal information is transferred to third parties outside of Canada, it will be protected with appropriate safeguards, but note that it may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction where it is held (for example, information stored in the United States may be subject to U.S. lawful access requests).</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">We take the security of your personal information seriously. Norhi has implemented <strong>technical, administrative, and physical safeguards</strong> to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, or modification. These safeguards include measures such as encryption, secure servers, access controls, and regular security assessments. We limit access to personal data to those employees, contractors, and agents who require such access to carry out their duties.</p>
                    
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">We also train our staff on privacy best practices to ensure your information is handled in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. In the unlikely event of a data breach that poses a risk of significant harm, we will notify affected individuals and relevant authorities as required by Canadian law.</p>

                        <li>We may retain your account information while your account is active and for a period after your account is closed, in case you decide to reactivate the service, to resolve disputes, or as needed to comply with legal obligations (such as record-keeping requirements).</li>
                        <li>If you contact us with a question or support request, we may retain the correspondence as long as necessary to assist with your inquiry and for our records.</li>
                        <li>If information is collected for a specific short-term purpose (e.g., a contest or event registration), we will dispose of or anonymize the information after that purpose is fulfilled.</li>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">When personal information is no longer required, we will securely destroy, erase, or anonymize it. We continuously review our data retention practices to ensure they are aligned with legal requirements and our internal data retention policies.</p>

                        <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> Where we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. For example, you can opt out of marketing emails by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in the email or by contacting us directly (see <strong>Email Communications and CASL Compliance</strong> below). Please note that withdrawing consent for certain uses of your information may mean we can no longer provide you with certain services. In some cases, we may continue to retain or use your information if we have a legal obligation to do so or if required to protect our legal interests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you have an account with us, you may request that we delete your account and personal information.

                        <li><strong>Challenging Compliance:</strong> If you have questions, concerns, or complaints about our privacy practices or compliance with this Privacy Policy, you have the right to raise these with us (see <strong>Contact Us</strong> below).

If you are an existing client or have an established business relationship with us, we may send you relevant information under the implied consent provisions of CASL, but we will ensure that such communications meet CASL requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identification and Unsubscribe:</strong> All marketing emails from Norhi will clearly identify us as the sender and include our mailing address and a clear <strong>unsubscribe</strong> link or instructions.
